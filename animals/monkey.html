    <p class="description">The monkey is a kind of wise and flexible creature, looks like the human most. The biologist Charles Darwin has written in his book On the Origin of Species that Humans are evolved from apes. So, the monkey can be as clever as the humans to some extent. You can also get this from the Monkey King, the main character in one of the four famous Chinese novels - Journey to the West. By using his wisdom, the Monkey King defeats the evil spirits and ghosts, helping his companions finish the journey to the West successfully. <br /><br />

The people born in the year of the monkey are of great intellects and skillful. They are usually good leaders. Quick and intelligent as they are, they can win prizes frequently from childhood, thus, often appreciated by parents and teachers. Besides, they are most in good physical conditions. Not only good in fortune when they are young, but also perfect after middle ages. As they are good at saving up money, they usually live lives without worrying about food and clothing.<br /><br />

The people under the sign of the monkey are sometimes a bit quick-tempered. This may hinder them from getting success. So, they should learn to be patient to overcome. They also like to project themselves to attract others. As they have extraordinary ability to distinguish between things, they can always make good decisions. In their families, they are usually considerate and thoughtful.</p>
