    <p class="description">It’s a fate that rat and human beings are greatly related with each other. They often eat our food and have the ability to survive at anywhere without picky about food. Because of this, the people born in the year of the Rat are outgoing, optimistic and highly adaptable in any environment. They are not the people who haggle over every ounce but stay at ease under all circumstances. So, they are easy to be liked and helped by others. <br />

      The Rat people are endowed with the power of acute observation, anticipation, and visionary power. You can get a validation from an old saying among the boatmen – ‘Rats leave (or desert or forsake) a sinking ship’ which means the rat can aware that the ship will be wrecked and run away in advance. Also, for a factory, once there are rats run out one after another, it predicts the fire damage is coming soon. Because of the ability, the rat people are usually good at some creativity works. They can be artistic creators, inventors, innovators etc. However, they should not rely on this power to deal with things completely. Think hard and ask for the opinions from others are very important. </p>
