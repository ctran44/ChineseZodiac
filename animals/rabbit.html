    <p class="description">The rabbit is a kind of docile animals. They are silent and lovely with no fighting force. They like to lie down silently at most of the time which looks lazy and weak. While, once running, they act very swiftly. It is the same as the people under the sign of the rabbit. When silent, they appear to be very quiet; when move, they are very vigorous and active. Once there are disagreements, they would not attack or offend others but doing their affairs peacefully. Not  like the tiger people, there will no big ups and downs for the fate of the people born in the year of the rabbit. Their fortune can reach the summit during the middle ages and go down smoothly later.  <br /><br />
      The men under the sign of the rabbit are most family-type. They are fond of trimming the garden, interior decoration and much other housework. As they are usually quiet, the weak, steady and elegant women fit them perfectly. Too extroverted women will be hard to live with them harmoniously. <br /><br />
      The women under the sign of the rabbit are usually perceptual, considerate and thoughtful. They have a keen sense of color and pay great attention to the emotion and atmosphere. So, they can be good secretaries, dinner hostesses and reception staffs.</p>
