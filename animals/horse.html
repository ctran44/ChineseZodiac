    <p class="description">People born in the year of the Horse are fiery, warm-hearted and generous. There are always plenty of friends around them as they are good at getting along with others. But they are not good at keeping secrets. They prefer social activities because of which, there are usually too many overheads preventing them from saving up money. <br /><br />

Open-minded and positive are strong points for the person under the sign of the Horse, but the drawback is that he/she often can not insist on doing things from the beginning to the end. Although showing positive attitude at the beginning, they are easy to give up once encounter small obstacles. Due to this reason, they are usually thought to be lack of responsibility. Most of them like to leave away from home to struggle for their career in youth. So they are easily to succeed when they are young but begin to encounter failure from the middle age. <br /> <br/>

In love, the Horse person is straightforward and focuses much on appearance. So they are always attractive. However, due to their never-lasting character trait, they usually couldn’t go long with their mates. Also in work, although they have excellent physical conditioning, they couldn’t get great success because of such characters.</p>
