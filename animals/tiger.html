    <p class="description">Inhabit in the wide field, the tiger is active, full of valour and vigour in nature. The people born in the year of the Tiger also have these kinds of personalities. They usually act actively but with caution. Once speaking out, they will never regret. Also, they never give up halfway until reach the goal. Although loyal to friends, sometimes they are thought to be not sophisticated enough as they like to stubbornly and arbitrarily cling to their own courses. They would not blame fate and other people but try to overcome when meeting obstacles in career. <br /><br/>
      The people under the sign of the tiger like going straight. They would go straight forward instead of using some diplomatic means to overcome difficulties which usually make others unpleasant. But they can still finish the task at last. The talented tiger people are ambitions and never satisfied with the general working environment. So, you can see many of them play job-hopping regularly. In career, they usually choose large companies where they could show out their abilities fully and easy to be promoted to a higher position. The shortcomings for them are that they usually act independently, and donâ€™t take colleagues to heart as well as looking down upon them.</p>
