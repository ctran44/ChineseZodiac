    <p class="description">The snake usually makes a bad impression to people as they are thought to be insidious, cunning and devious. Sometimes, in China, the snake is called the 'Little Dragon' as it resembles the dragon in appearance. The person born in the year of the snake projects a perfectly cool exterior at most of the times like the snake has a cool snake skin. In fact, under the calm appearance, hides an eternally fervent heart. At one time, they can composedly observe things around and carry out the task quietly. On the other hand, they are passionate to help others. These can be especially seen from their initiative in helping new colleagues and friends. So they are easy to be trusted and popular among the people. For the women, they are sociable with remarkable disposition. Especially at the dance party, they are usually welcomed and invited by many men. <br/><br/>

The people under the sign of snake are warm-hearted, positive, willing to accept the challenge and can try very hard to finish the task well. Not as sinister as the real snake, they are beautiful and incredibly sexy and usually behave finely. Both of the men and women are hot and sexy. Most of them are married after having love affairs instead of arranged marriages. Their love can be very sweet. If they can show their enthusiasm in real family life, they can live more happily and last long. You can see the snake people's persistence in love through the traditional Chinese story of 'The White Snake'. Also, the snake people will use unscrupulous divisive tactics to win what they want. In terms of their fortune, it will be smooth when they are young and very good during late years.</p>
