    <p class="description">Ox plays great important role in people's life. Without the Ox's hard work in agriculture, human society couldn't make such a rapid progress. As the ox act slowly but having a strong will and are industrious, the people born in the year of the ox also have these kinds of nature. No matter how terrible the surroundings are and what other people say, they usually go forward to do things step by step and finish finally. <br /> <br />
      The ox is one of ruminant animals. They need to munch repeatedly for a long time without swallowing hastily when eating in order to digest the food completely. This is the same with the people under the ox sign. They like to think hard and ponder repeatedly for a long time before taking actions. Because of this, they are thought to be the kind of people thinking too much and too much questions. However, once begin to act; they will carry it off courageously without a hitch and rest. The disadvantage for them is that they lack of the flexibility ability to adapt to changes in the market. They usually insist on holding by their decisions and would like not to change which shows to be stubborn in other people's eyes.</p>
