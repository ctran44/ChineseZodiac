    <p class="description">The rooster is the dawn announcer waking people up on time in the morning. Since the ancient times, it has been thought to have the ability of divining the future. Also in Greek mythology, it is said that the rooster can feel what will happen in the future. So, it is regarded as the god's ambassador. The people born in the year of the rooster also have the ability to discern what is coming. They like to think more and have a good plan when dealing with things. Also, they usually use in ways others could never have imagined to solve problems which making others surprise. <br/><br/>

The people under the Rooster sign are warm, generous, diligent, sociable and very capable speakers. They have quick wit and think fast. So sometimes they are impatient. When talking, they may stammer as their mouth couldn’t catch up with the brain. To change this, they need to think slowly. The men born in the year of the rooster usually pay great attention on his appearance. They dress well no matter in casual clothes or suit. The women also are beautifully dressed with a variety of colors. As they attach great importance to the attire, they look upon with disapproval to those who dress casually and don’t like to communicate with them. Therefore, they usually leave an impression of coldness to others.</p>
