    <p class="description">the sheep is also a kind of docile animals. They have low combat effectiveness and ask for nothing but live with the green grass peacefully. So, they are usually attacked by other animals. In the flock, they observe the discipline of the leader sheep well and hold the leader in the greatest esteem. Due to these, Jesus hailed himself as 'a Good Shepherd'. <br/><br/>

The sheep are mild and close with the human. Especially in the Middle East, the people rely on the sheep to survive greatly. The sheep can coexist with the humans peacefully and migrate with them on grassland. So they have remarkable endurance and assiduous spirit. These are also the characters of the people born in the year of the sheep. Beside, the sheep people have a strong vitality. There is an iron will and enterprising spirit underlying their soft and fluffy fa√ßade. When dealing with tasks, they are not impulsive but always considerate, analyze carefully and complete satisfactorily. In interpersonal relationship, as they are gentle and cultivated, they are liked by others. In terms of business, they are always wonderful hands. But sometimes, things can be made terrible because of their strong heart. <br/><br/>

The people under the sheep sign are most flexible and have bright body. The men may look like sissy. While, the women are with a devilish charm to the opposite sex, as they are mostly beautiful, plump, clear in skin and slim in waist.</p>
