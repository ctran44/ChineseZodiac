    <p class="description">Among all the twelve Chinese zodiac signs, dragon is the only fictitious and deified animal that doesn't exist in the world. It is one of the four most revered animals of ancient China (they other three are phoenix, tortoise and kylin). The dragon images now we see are just from people's imagination. Because of this, the people born in the year of the dragon are usually dreamers fond of imagining. This gives others an unreal sense about them. To mention about their work, they can work hard at the beginning but usually give up once encounter difficulties. The permanent jobs with fixed salary are not fit for them. Those need more imagination like interior designers, architects, artists or cultural workers are suitable for them. The dragon women usually are typical modern occupation female paying much attention to their work while neglecting marriage. In general, the people under the dragon sign are mostly marry at a mature age as concentrating too much on their career.
